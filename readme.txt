Head Control App (HCAs)

DESCRIPTION
This code makes use of the Intel® RealSense™ SDK for Windows in a C#/WPF desktop application. This app, named Head Contol App, utilizes the Intel RealSense SDK to enable the full control of a web browser while only using head gestures.

NOTES
1. The full functionality of this sample app requires a front-facing 3D camera.
2. This project uses an explicit path to libpxcclr.cs.dll (the managed RealSense DLL): C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\RSSDK\bin\x64. This reference will need to be changed if your installation path is different.

Created By: Alex Milman based on Intel's Block Head Sample Code for the RealSense Camera
